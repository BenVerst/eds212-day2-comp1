## Derivatives in R

```{r}
fx <- expression(3.1 * x^4 - 28 * x)

#this is storing the derivative expression
df_dx <- D(fx, 'x')

#this calls it back (show me)
df_dx

x <- 10

eval(df_dx)

```

you try! Find the slope of g(z) = 2z^3^ - 10.5z\^2 + 4.1 at z=3.6

```{r}
gz <- expression(2 * z^3 - 10.5 * z^2 + 4.1)

#this is storing the derivative expression
df_dz <- D(gz, 'z')

#this calls it back (show me)
df_dz

z <- 3.6

eval(df_dz)
```

```{r}
gt <- expression(2 * t^3 - 10.5 * t^2 + 4.1)

#this is storing the derivative expression
df_dt <- D(gt, 't')

#this calls it back (show me)
df_dt

t <- seq(from = 1, to = 3, length = 20)

eval(df_dt)
```
